# sqlite-todo
This is a documented Expo/React Native example of using `expo-lite`
It is almost entirely a recreation of 
Evan Bacon's [examples/with-sqlite](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-sqlite)

It is loaded here for an example for the [Lethbridge College](https://lethbridgecollege.ca) CIT2269 Mobile Application Design course
